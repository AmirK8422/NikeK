      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        We (more specifically me) are a team filled with talents <br />
        and passion for fashion and style in the modern day, because of the{" "}
        <br />
        oricing today many people may not be abale to buy the products they like{" "}
        <br />
        so I created this oppertunity at NikeK for people of my country to be
        able <br />
        to follow the styles they want without having to put so much money on
        it.
